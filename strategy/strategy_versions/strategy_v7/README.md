# Race Completion
This is version 7 of our velocity optimiser.
This version was developed for the energy audit deadline and hence would require future features

### Key Points
- minimises time
- velocity profile taken at constant distance interval
- power constrained, battery constrained

### Future Planned Features:
- [ ] Control Stop integration
- [ ] Solcast API integration
- [ ] Making model run on whole race data.
